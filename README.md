# TranZlator
Welcome to **TranZlator**!

Damn, I'm too lazy to write a damn description after coding this shit!
All you need to know: It translates other people's chats into any language ;)

### Features
- **Enable/Disable Translation**: Because why bother learning a new language when a script can do it for you?
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: From English to Swahili, we've got you covered (well, not you specifically, but you get the point).

### Installation
1. **Download the Latest Version**: Get the latest version from [Here](https://github.com/Cracky0001/Stand-TranZlator/releases/latest).
2. **Place `TranZlator.lua` in Scripts Directory**: Only the `TranZlator.lua` file is needed. Everything else would be a waste of space.
4. **Enable Internet Connection**: Seriously, make sure the script can use the internet or it will annoy you forever.

### Troubleshooting
- **No Translations?**: Check if you disabled the "Disable Internet Access" Toggle.
- **Weird Translations?**: Blame Google Translate. It has a mind of its own.
- **Annoying Toast Messages?**: That's just the script's way of showing love.

TranZlater is not responsible for any miscommunications, hilarious mistranslations, or general chaos that may ensue. Use at your own risk!
